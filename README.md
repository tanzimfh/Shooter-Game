### My ICS4U final project: a 2D reimagination of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege

As a special forces operator, protect an important asset against armed enemies. Pick your loadout from a range of different weapons to fit your playstyle and survive waves of enemies by setting traps and reinforcing (or destroying) doors and walls. Manage your time and resources effectively in addition to hitting your shots to win.
